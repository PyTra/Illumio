# Illumio Coding Challenge by Travis Yu


I manually tested my solution with the boundaries listed in the input.

I'm not entirely sure if my code is completely optimized. I decided to use a combination of a hashmap and a dataframe in order to store the data. I'm not entirely familiar with pandas so there might be better ways to implement my code. 
It should be O(n) time to store and O(n) time to lookup.


My rankings for the team are
1. Platform
2. Data
3. Policy
